              She was a Swedish artist and mystic whose paintings are considered among the first major abstract works in
              Western
              art history. A considerable body of her work predates the first purely abstract compositions by Kandinsky,
              Malevich and Mondrian. She belonged to a group called "The Five", comprising a circle of women inspired by
              Theosophy, who shared a belief in the importance of trying to contact the so-called "High Masters"—often
              by way
              of séances. Her paintings, which sometimes resemble diagrams, were a visual representation of complex
              spiritual ideas.
            </p>
            <p>According to H.P. Blavatsky, mediumship was a faulty practice, leading its
              adepts on the wrong path of occultism and black magic. However, during their meeting, Steiner stated that
              af
              Klint's contemporaries would not be able to accept and understand her paintings, and it would take another
              50
              years to decipher them. Of all the paintings shown to him, Steiner paid special attention only to the
              <b>Primordial
                Chaos</b> Group, noting them as <mark>"the best symbolically"</mark>. After meeting Steiner, af Klint
              was
              <em>devastated</em>
              by his
              response and, apparently, <b>stopped painting for 4 years</b>. Steiner kept photographs of some of af
              Klint's
              artworks,
              some of them even hand-coloured. Later the same year he met Wassily Kandinsky, who had not yet come to
              abstract
              painting. Some art historians assume that Kandinsky could have seen the photographs and perhaps was
              influenced
              by them while developing his own abstract path. Later in her life, af Klint made a decision to destroy all
              her correspondence.

              Loïs Mailou Jones (1905 – 1998) was an extraordinary artist and educator whose career spanned seven
              decades.
              Despite her significant contributions to the art world, her relative obscurity for much of her career can
              be attributed to systemic issues surrounding race, gender, and the art world’s focus during her lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>Jones was active during a time when African American artists were systematically excluded from major
              galleries, museums, and art institutions. Black artists were rarely taken seriously by the predominantly
              white art establishment, and their work was often categorized as "folk art" or "craft" rather than "fine
              art."
            </p>
            <p>
              Black artists faced challenges accessing the same level of training, networks, and sponsorships as their
              white counterparts, limiting opportunities for exposure and recognition. Also, as a woman in the early and
              mid-20th century, Jones faced additional challenges in gaining recognition in a male-dominated field.
              Women artists, regardless of race, were frequently marginalized and overlooked.

              Albert Pinkham Ryder (1847–1917) was a highly original American painter whose work has had a lasting
              influence on modern art. Despite this, Ryder was obscure during his lifetime and even in the years after
              his death.
            </p>
            <p><strong>"The Lovers' Boat"</strong> depicts a dreamlike scene of two figures in a boat gliding across a
              shimmering,
              moonlit sea. Its romantic and mystical subject matter was out of step with the tastes of Ryder’s time,
              which leaned more toward realism and historical narratives.
              This kind of imagery, focused on mood and emotion, was difficult for contemporary audiences to understand
              or categorize.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ryder's visionary and poetic style, characterized by dreamy, mysterious, and often abstract landscapes and
              allegorical scenes, was not easily understood or appreciated by his contemporaries.
              His art anticipated modernist movements like Symbolism and Abstract Expressionism, but these styles only
              gained traction after his death.
            </p>
            <p>Ryder's fixation on themes of love, nature, and the spiritual journey—as seen in "The Lovers' Boat" — was
              <strong>considered overly romantic</strong> by the standards of his contemporaries. These themes, however,
              would later
              resonate with modernists who appreciated his visionary and deeply personal approach.

              Gerda Taro worked closely with Robert Capa, her romantic partner and collaborator. Together, they covered
              the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and published images under the shared credit "Capa & Taro."
              Over time, Capa's fame as a legendary war photographer overshadowed Taro's contributions. Many of her
              photographs were incorrectly attributed to Capa, and her independent work was largely forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>Garo's career was tragically short. She died at the age of 26 in a vehicle collision while covering the
              Spanish Civil War. Her premature death cut short her potential to establish a broader legacy and body of
              work.
              Her death also meant that she could not actively promote or archive her work, leaving her legacy to be
              shaped by others.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a woman in a male-dominated field, Taro faced systemic challenges to gaining recognition. Her
              achievements were often downplayed, while male photographers were more readily celebrated and included in
              historical narratives.
              Her innovative approach to war photography—focusing on the human cost of conflict and capturing moments of
              intimacy and resilience—was sometimes dismissed as less significant than the more action-oriented images
              preferred by the male-dominated press.

              The Adventures of Prince Achmed (German: Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed) is a 1926 German animated
              fairytale film by Lotte Reiniger. It is the oldest surviving animated feature film. (Two earlier ones
              had been made in Argentina by Quirino Cristiani, but they are considered to be lost.) The Adventures of
              Prince Achmed features a silhouette animation technique Reiniger had invented that involved manipulated
              cutouts made from cardboard and thin sheets of lead under a camera. The technique she used for the
              camera is similar to Wayang shadow puppets, though hers were animated frame by frame, not manipulated in
              live action. The original prints featured color tinting. Reiniger also used the first form of a multiplane
              camera in making the film, one of the most important devices in pre digital animation.
            </p>
            <p>During the early 20th century, filmmaking was heavily dominated by men, and women’s contributions were
              often undervalued or overlooked. Despite her pioneering work, Reiniger’s achievements were not celebrated
              as widely as her male contemporaries, such as Walt Disney or Georges Méliès.
            </p>
            <p>
              Film history has historically focused on male innovators and mainstream narratives, sidelining women’s
              work, especially in niche or experimental areas.
            </p>
            <p>Reiniger's use of silhouette animation, while innovative and visually stunning, was not mainstream. This
              made her work harder to categorize alongside more prominent animation styles, such as hand-drawn cel
              animation popularized by studios like Disney.</p>
            <p>Her intricate, shadow-puppet-inspired animations had strong ties to German Expressionism and traditional
              art forms, which may not have resonated widely with international audiences used to different styles.</p>
